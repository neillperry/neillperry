### Hello, fans ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer turned security engineer. I have learned a little about a lot - Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, Assembly, etc. Most of my repositories here on GitHub are from classes and training that I have completed.  However, I am now pivoting towards learning about malware analysis and reverse engineering.  

- âš¡ Fun fact: I can name 46 out of 50 state capitals.
