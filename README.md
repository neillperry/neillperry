### Hello, fans ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior software developer apprentice. I have learned a little about a lot - Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, Assembly, etc. Most of my repositories here are from classes and training that I have completed. 

I enjoy soccer. I've even volunteered as a youth soccer coach on occasion. I work at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). If you would like to know more, you can visit my [Website](https://www.neillperry.com) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neillperry). 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I can name 46 out of 50 state capitals.
